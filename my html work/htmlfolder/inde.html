    <p>The time is here! Many of you have been asking on Discord when our group projects / open source projects will
        begin.</p>
    <p><strong>Well, today is the start of something amazing with our community of 50,000 students:</strong>&nbsp; You
        can now&nbsp;<strong>join open source projects created by our community</strong>, and then&nbsp;<strong>work
            with fellow students to build the next app or startup</strong>. Why would you want to do this?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Working in teams with&nbsp;fellow students will prepare you for the job market where you will be working
                with others using Github.&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&nbsp;You can expand your portfolio by adding projects you have worked on with others.&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&nbsp;You contribute to open source.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&nbsp;On your resume, you will be able to showcase that you&nbsp;started an open source project and self
                organized with your fellow students. I don't know about you, but I would hire someone who shows
                initiative like that :).&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>So how do you get started?<br><br>There is a special section I have added to the course: "Git + Github +
            Open Source Projects" where I take you through a step by step video on how to contribute to open
            source&nbsp;projects and build real life projects.<br><br></strong>However, I only recommend starting to
        contribute to open source<strong> once you get to that section. </strong>I put this quick lesson here in case
        someone who has a bit of experience already with development wants to get started on this right
        away.&nbsp;Otherwise, see you in that section</p>
